# üë¥ Rick And Morty üë¶

This project was developed for fun. :)

You can easily download and use this application, which I made using JavaScript and CSS. Thanks to this application in which I used Rick And Morty's API, we will be able to see it on this site even if new characters are added to the series.

You can see all the characters, living characters, and dead characters for pages, respectively.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

Cloning this project can teach you basic API usage and make you want to watch Rick and Morty. Be careful!
